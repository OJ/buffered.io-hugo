title: Random Resolutions
---

I've never been one to make New Years Resolutions. I think they're a bit of a wank to be honest. But I do love a good gimmick. So when I stumbled on <a href="http://resolutionrandomizer.pop.us/ecard.aspx" title="Resolution Randomizer">this</a> I both loved and hated it.

<a href="/uploads/2008/12/res_1.png" title="Resolution 1" rel="lightbox[resolutions]"><img src="/uploads/2008/12/res_1.png" alt="Resolution 1" style="border: 0; float: left; margin-right: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"/></a> This first attempt made me chuckle. I think all the time, let alone at inappropriate times. The bigger question is: <em>what should I be thinking about at inappropriate times?</em>.

Who knows.
<div style="float:none; clear:both;"></div>
<a href="/uploads/2008/12/res_2.png" title="Resolution 2" rel="lightbox[resolutions]"><img src="/uploads/2008/12/res_2.png" alt="Resolution 2" style="border: 0; float: right; margin-left: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"/></a>After this second one appeared I thought that this thing knew more about me than I felt comfortable about. So I stopped right there.

This is quite a neat little Silverlight app. One that I think most people will get a kick out of, even if it's just for a few minutes. Enjoy.
