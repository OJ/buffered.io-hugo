title: Should I Install Vista?
---

This isn't a question directed at you guys :) This is a question that lots of people have been asking me of late, and I felt the need to answer the question once and for all.
<ul><li>The short answer is: <strong>No</strong>.</li><li>The medium answer is: I have a licenced copy because I am an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" title="MSDN">MSDN</a> subscriber and I <em>still</em> haven't installed it. So what does that tell you?</li><li>The long answer is: If you are looking for an operating system that chews up a lot of resources, behaves like Windows XP with a new coat of paint, doesn't play nicely with most of the games on the market, takes away your rights as a user and consumer of most forms of digital content <strong>and</strong> gives you constant issues with your hardware, then <em>yes</em>. If you'd prefer to have control over your computer instead of giving that control to Microsoft, then I highly recommend avoiding it.</li></ul>

If you don't have any issues using Windows XP then I feel you have no reason to upgrade. If you have issues running Windows XP then you're going to have a big problem getting Vista to work, and hence you should consider something else (like Linux).

All flames, trolls and whinging repsonses are welcome :)
