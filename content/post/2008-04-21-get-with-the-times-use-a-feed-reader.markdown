title: Get with the Times - Use a Feed Reader

Regular readers of <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/" title="Dilbert">Dilbert</a> are currently <a href="http://entertainment.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=08/04/19/1842208&from=rss" title="Slashdot | Dilbert Goes Flash, Readers Revolt">kicking and screaming</a> about the site's new <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/" title="Adobe Flash">Flash</a>-based design. Personally I don't mind it, but at the end of the day it matters not.

Why?

<!--more-->

The site finally has it's own <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/DilbertDailyStrip" title="The Dilbert Daily Strip">feed</a> which puts the comics straight into your <a href="http://reader.google.com/" title="Google Reader">favourite feed reader</a>. If you can see it in your reader, why bother visiting the site? Haven't these people got used to alternate delivery mechanisms yet? Why whinge when they actually have better access?

If I was going to have a gripe, I'd complain about the fact that Dilbert.com doesn't have the appropriate header tags which specify the alternate format for feed in the site's html source. Poor form.

Anyway, skip the site, hit the feed :)
