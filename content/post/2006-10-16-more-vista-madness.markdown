title: More Vista Madness
---

And so the Vista malarky continues! More and more details of the behemoth that is Vista are coming to light which, quite frankly, freak me out even more.

First of all, <a href="http://www.virtualization.info/2006/10/microsoft-denies-some-vista-editions.html" title="virtualization.info: Microsoft denies some Vista editions to run virtualized">Microsoft won't let you run some Vista editions virtualised</a>, which is a bit of a surprise. Why would they push for free Virtual PC software and then not let you use some basic versions of the new OS under such a set up?

Secondly, despite there being large support for a 3D desktop, the coverage in the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35084" title="Vista RC 2 gaming with Nvidia not there yet">game area is lacking</a>. WTF is going on here? So we're going to make it hard for the gamers to move over as well? This is just unbelievable.

I think that <a href="http://www.from9till2.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=227f20b1-adfe-4361-b776-111a7069f622" title="From 9 till 2 - Vista the Adventure Game">this</a> nugget of genius sums it up nicely :) This will hit home for those who have spent any time in text-based adventure games and/or MUDs.
