title: ViEmu for SQL
---

Another quick note today (it's late, and I need to sleep :)), and again it's VIM related.  The dude that made ViEmu that I mentioned a couple of days back has come up with <a href="http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-sql-server-management-studio.html" title="ViEmu SQL">another plugin</a> - this time for SQL Server 2005 Managment Studio. It weighs in at a hefty USD$99.95 which, in my opinion, is quite a hefty price tag just to be able to write SQL in VIM. You can get both for USD$139 which saves you USD$30 on the two, but again I feel that's a bit much for what you get. Sure I'm becoming a bigger fan of VIM by the day, but I doubt I'll consider buying anything more than the Visual Studio integration.

Tomorrow I'll be having a rant about what I think a developer wants from his day job (or perhaps what I think he/she <em>should</em> want ;)).
