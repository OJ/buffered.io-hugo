title: Haskell 101 at the Brisbane Functional Programming Meetup
---

I just thought I'd let the world know that tomorrow night, at 6pm AEST, the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group-BFG/" title="Brisbane Functional Programming Group ">Brisbane Functional Programming Group</a> is having another <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group-BFG/calendar/11039537/" title="Intro to FP & Haskell 101">get-together</a>. The topics for the meeting are:
<ul>
	<li>Introduction to Functional Programming - by Brad Clow</li>
	<li>Haskell 101 - by me!</li>
</ul>
There are still spots available if you're keen to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group-BFG/calendar/11039537/" title="Intro to FP & Haskell 101">come along</a>. It should be fun!

I'm always up for some public scrutiny, so come along and bring your rotten tomatoes.

If you can't make it, I'll post the slides for the talk on this site, and on Meetup.com, when the event has finished so you can see what was covered. Feel free to ping me or ask questions.

<strong>Update 19th Aug '09</strong>
The talk seemed to go quite well. I had to motor through the material quite quickly due to the late start, but on the whole I think it was well received. I haven't had any negative feedback so far ;)

Slides/content are now <a href="/uploads/2009/08/Haskell101-20090818.zip" title="Slides and source for Haskell 101">up for grabs</a>!
