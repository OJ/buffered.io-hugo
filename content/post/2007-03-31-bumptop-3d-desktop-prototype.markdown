title: BumpTop 3D Desktop Prototype
---

I was sent an interesting link this morning by <a href="http://pervivere.blogspot.com/" title="Simon Shea">Simon</a> that I think you guys will find quite interesting too (especially those of you with a passion for human/computer interaction *cough* <strong>Dan</strong> *cough*).

Introducing the <a href="http://www.bumptop.com/" title="BumpTop 3D Desktop">BumpTop 3D Desktop</a>, a crazy new way of interacting with your machine and handling documents/files.  Check out the following <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0ODskdEPnQ" title="BumpTop">YouTube</a> vid to see how it works:

Pretty groovey hey!  Of course, this looks like it was designed to work moreso with hand-held or tablet PCs (the "pressure" gestures are a bit of a give-away there), but it'd be cool to see something like this on a desktop machine.

I do wonder if this kind of mechanism would be more intuitive to a user though.  While it looks cool and makes a bit of sense (based on the description), I think using it would be slow compared to the conventional desktop.  What do you think?
