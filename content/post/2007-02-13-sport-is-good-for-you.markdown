title: Sport is Good For You
---

I love my sport. Without it I'd go nuts. It's a great venting mechanism, it lets you burn off calories and makes you feel good.

You might lose a game, or run a bad time, or twist your ankle - you might even get clobbered by someone on the opposite team and end up in quite a bit of pain.  Last night's game of indoor soccer proved to be fairly tough :) Not because the game was especially taxing, but more because the team we played against were a bunch of thugs. Luckily for them they were close friends of the Referee, and hence some seriously dubious calls were made in their favour. We were battered constantly without compensation by the Ref, and when we fought back we were penalised. Frustrating to say the least. We finished the game at 4 - 4, and hobbled off the court. The piccy to the left (click on it to zoom) is a shot of my least painful injury - it's of the inside of my left leg after I threw myself in front of a guy taking a shot at goal. The ball was new, very shiny and pumped up way too hard.  Ouch.

As a small moral victory, the fact they didn't beat us in the second round means that they won't get another shot at us. This gives us a season victory over them because we beat them 8 - 1 in the first round. Isn't it amazing what you can do when your whole team turns up!
