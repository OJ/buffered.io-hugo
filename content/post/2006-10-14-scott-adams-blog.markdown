You've probably all guessed by now that I'm a bit of a <a href="http://www.dilbert.com" title="Dilbert">Dilbert</a> fan, especially considering that it feels like a I work with most of those characters!

While browsing through the recent cartoons, I noticed that there was a link to <a href="http://dilbertblog.typepad.com/" title="The Dilbert Blog">Scott Adam's Blog</a> which I proceeded to follow and I was greeted with some really interesting reading. So if you've got some time to kill and are interested in getting into the amazing mind of the man behind Dilbert, get on over there and have a read!
