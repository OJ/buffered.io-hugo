Yes this is old news to anyone who reads any form of news :) But Google have bought YouTube! How exciting. Personally, I'm very happy for those lads who set YouTube up in the first place. The idea was based on the need to share some large homes videos of parties with mates who weren't there, and it's turned into a multi-billion dollar empire. It's good to hear that there are people out there like this still making something big for themselves for having the balls to give it a go.

On a slightly more sour note, it looks like the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35026">lawsuits</a> will start queuing up. Everyone with any connection to some of the "unauthorised" content on YouTube will probably join the long line of would-be beneficiaries from sueing Google/YouTube for breach of copyright. Let's hope that this kind of thing is nipped in the bud.
