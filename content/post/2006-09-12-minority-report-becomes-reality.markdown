title: Minority Report becomes Reality?
---

I was hoping to find a little more time this evening to write up some thoughts about Enterprise Application Development but that's going to have to wait since it's getting late and I have to be up early in the morning.

So for now, I think all of you would enjoy taking a peek at something a good mate of mine in the U.K. (Mark Webster) pointed me at earlier today.  It's a YouTube video called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLhMVNdplJc&NR" title="Minority Report becomes reality">Minority Report becomes reality</a>. Absolutely fascinating! It's nice to think that we've got people working on some funky new ways for us to interact with our machines. I hope that brings with it some really cool challenges for the coders and designers to face when it comes to buildling applications that utilise interfaces like these.
