title: An All Too Common Issue
---

I think the following statement goes <strong>way</strong> deeper than it may have been intended (I might be wrong of course)...
<blockquote cite="Raymond Chen"><p>Engineering is about making tradeoffs. If you refuse to make the choice, then you're taking the cowardly route and ultimately are creating more work for your team. Instead of solving problems, you're <em>creating</em> them.

All because you're too chicken to make a hard decision.</p></blockquote>
Thank you, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/posts/9416485.aspx" title="The checkbox: The mating call of the loser">Raymond Chen</a>! You are a legend.
