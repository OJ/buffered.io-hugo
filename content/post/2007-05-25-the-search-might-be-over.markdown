title: The Search Might be Over
---

<a href="/uploads/2007/05/block.jpg" title="The Block" rel="lightbox"><img src="/uploads/2007/05/block_thumb.jpg" alt="The Block" class="InlineImageLeft" /></a>Today we may well have come to the end of our search. Tomorrow morning, at 8am, we meet the Real Estate agent and if things go to plan, we may well be making an offer on a block of land! How exciting. Check out the pic to see what we're contemplating ;) It's just over an acre, and looks to be exactly what we've been searching for.

I'll post again tomorrow and let you know how it goes! Now it's time for bed.
