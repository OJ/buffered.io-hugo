title: I've Caved-in to Twitter
---

I was against the idea for ages, but for some reason I've decided to start using it. <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> was one of those things that I didn't see a need for. Now I can.

I'll be using it to keep track of ideas I have for blog posts as well as other things that I need to get done. If you feel like tracking me or joining me in a conversation, please feel free to <a href="http://twitter.com/TheColonial" >add me</a> to your follow list.

I've put a mini-feed of my thoughts in the sidebar (which currently only appears on the index page - need to fix that). Don't worry, I won't be clogging this blog's RSS with my twitters. It drives me mad when other people do it, so I refuse to do it myself.

Watch this space - my Unity Build screencast will be up shortly!
