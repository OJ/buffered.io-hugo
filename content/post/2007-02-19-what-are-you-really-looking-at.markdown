title: What are you Really Looking at?
---

We all know that the pictures that we find in magazines, posters and movies are edited. A lot. But it's hard to really get a good idea of what actually goes on behind the scenes until you see something like <a href="http://blog.futurelab.net/2006/10/this_video_is_important.html" title="Marketing &amp; Strategy Innovation Blog: this video is important">this</a>. Scary eh? Makes you realise that absolutely anyone can be "model material" as long as they have a stack of make-up and a friend who's good enough with photoshop.

Amazing how this also relates to software isn't it!?
