I've had a few questions from people asking me why there's a stack of <em>queer</em> looking icons appearing at the bottom of the blog posts, so I thought I'd post the details so that everyone knows.

The icons appear because of a plugin I recently installed called <a href="http://www.calevans.com/view.php/page/notable" title="Notable Wordpress Plugin">Notable</a>.  Notable is a plugin that generates links that allow for easy addition of links to various social bookmarking and networking sites.  Here's a bit of a snippet from the web page:<blockquote>Notable displays a series of icons below each post allowing your readers to easily submit you to many different social bookmarking and networking sites.

This allows your users to easily submit your blog posts to these sites and increases your blog's visibility.</blockquote>So it's there to help you add my blog links to a stack of different pages should you feel the need to. Like what I said and want to bookmark it on a site like <a href="http://del.icio.us/" title="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>? Click that link and away it goes.  The icons that are listed are for a variety of possibly bookmarking and networking sites, and are there to try and accommodate whatever site you happen to like to use.

If you aren't into that kind of thing, then just ignore them :)
