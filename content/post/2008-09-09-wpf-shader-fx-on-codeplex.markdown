title: WPF Shader FX on Codeplex
---

This is just a quick post to point out a new project that has fired up on <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/" title="Codeplex">Codeplex</a> which may be of interest to a few of you graphics and rich client fans.

<a href="http://jcooney.net/" title="JCooney.NET">Joseph Cooney</a> of <a href="http://learnwpf.com/" title="Learn WPF">LearnWPF.com</a> (and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Presentation_Foundation" title="WPF">WPF</a> <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/" title="MVP">MVP</a> to the stars) has kicked off a <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/fx" title="FX project @ Codeplex">Codeplex project</a> targetting funky shaders for use with the new features of WPF that were included in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=ab99342f-5d1a-413d-8319-81da479ab0d7" title=".NET 3.5 SP1">SP1</a>. Specifically, it's intended to be a collection of open source/free shaders that can be easily plugged into your WPF apps to make them look schmick (for more info, <a href="http://learnwpf.com/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=398ed9d5-c56a-4ad5-830d-02e2d8d3bf26" title="WPF Shader Effects Community Project Launched">check this out</a>).

It's an open source/community thing where everyone is encouraged to contribute. I'll be aiming to add as much as I can given the time constraints of work and family life. JC has already added 5 effects, and I've added my first, which was a simple Radial Blur shader.

This stuff really is fun, so check it out!
