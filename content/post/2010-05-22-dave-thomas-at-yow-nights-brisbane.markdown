Nights Brisbane - May 20th">YOW! Nights</a> conference held at the local Microsoft Office here in Brisbane. The speaker for the session was none other than <a href="http://www.davethomas.net/" title="Dave Thomas">Dave Thomas</a>, the man behind the likes of <a href="http://objectmentor.com/" title="Object Mentor">ObjectMentor</a>. Not only is this guy incredibly switched on, he is thought-provoking and very entertaining to boot. I've been to a few of these sessions in the past but I've never seen one as packed out as this one. It was great to see such a turn-out, which no doubt was boosted by the presence of both the <a href="http://www.qmsdnug.org/" title="QMSDNUG">Queensland MSDN Users Group</a> and the <a href="http://bfpg.org/" title="BFPG">Brisbane Functional Programming Group</a>.

The talk was covering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" title="Functional Programming">Functional Programming</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL" title="NoSQL">NoSQL</a> movement (which, as Dave himself puts it, should be called <em>NoRDB</em>). These are two areas of computing that are currently key interests of mine, so it won't come as a surprise to find that I thoroughly enjoyed the talk. I certainly wasn't the only one. Dave did such a great job of covering the positives of these two movements that we're already seeing more and more people signing up for membership to <a href="http://bfpg.org/" title="BFPG">BFPG</a>.

I'm not going to go into the gory details about what Dave covered in his talk as I don't want to spoil it for other people if he plans on doing it again elsewhere. There are a few things I would like to mention though:
<ul>
  <li>Functional Programming is here to stay. If you're not familiar with it, or haven't yet taken a look at it, I suggest you get started!</li>
  <li>If you're looking to get involved with FP and you're in or around the Brisbane area, be sure to come to one of our <a href="http://bfpg.org/" title="BFPG">BFPG</a> meetups.</li>
  <li>Don't fall into the trap of assuming that if your system needs a back-end data store that an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system" title="Relational Database Management System">RDBMS</a> is the only option, because it's not!</li>
</ul>

This talk has inspired me to not only continue checking out the likes of <a href="http://haskell.org/" title="Haskell">Haskell</a>, <a href="http://erlang.org/" title="Erlang">Erlang</a> and <a href="http://riak.basho.com/" title="Riak">Riak</a>, it's pointed me at some languages that I never knew existed. Languages which are insanely powerful, very dense, yet still extremely useful. Some examples are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)" title="J">J</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)" title="K">K</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_(programming_language_from_Kx_Systems)" title="Q">Q</a>. <a href="http://www.kx.com/products/database.php" title="KDB+">KDB+</a> in particular is very interesting as it ties in with the use of another type of technology that I was aware of but knew nothing about: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-oriented_DBMS" title="Column Database">Column Databases</a>. Crazy stuff.

After seeing so many people excited by the prospect of Functional Programming after Dave's talk had concluded, I decided to set up a new website for <a href="http://bfpg.org/" title="BFPG">BFPG</a> so that we had a proper home rather than just a spot on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group-BFG/" title="BFPG @ Meetup.com">Meetup.com</a>. Check it out and feel free to send through some feedback if you have any, or <a href="http://bfpg.org/contact/" title="Contact BFPG">drop us a line</a> if you have any ideas for talks or would like to present something yourself.

That's it for today's brain-fart :)
