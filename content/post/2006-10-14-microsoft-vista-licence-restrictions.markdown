title: Microsoft Vista Licence Restrictions
---

The Inquirer has posted up some info on the <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=35057" title="Microsoft Vista licence restrictions hit hardware hard">Microsoft Vista licence restrictions</a> and boy does it sound awful. Not only will it cost you an arm and a leg to buy it, you'll probably have to upgrade to get it to run, and after you've upgraded you'll probably never be allowed to upgrade again - otherwise you'll need a new copy of Vista!

So, you're screwed in more ways than one. Every bit of news I'm hearing about Vista is scaring me at the moment. I really can't see why MS are taking the stance their taking and forcing such a pile-o-poop on its customers. If it goes the way their previous licence handling has gone (see my prior blog post on issues with Office Activation), then this is just going to be a hindrance to the honest paying customer, and the hackers are the ones who'll have it easy.

I'll be sticking with XP, Gentoo and Ubuntu! MS can take their licencing, their DRM and their snooping and stick it where the sun doesn't shine.
