But those of you who do, and who have noticed that I haven't posted for a little while may want to know why. The answer is: <strong>I have become a Father!</strong>

On Thursday the 7th Feb '08, Amy gave birth to our first child. A Son that we have called Marley (we're still trying to pick a middle name).  Here's a summary of the event:<ul><li><strong>7th @ 22:00</strong> - Amy's waters break at home while I'm on the phone to a friend in Darwin.</li><li><strong>7th @ 22:15</strong> - Contractions start and increase in frequency rather quickly.</li><li><strong>7th @ 22:45</strong> - We arrive at the hospital, the birthing suite is ready and we go straight in.</li><li><strong>7th @ 23:00</strong> - <strike>Living Hell</strike> Labour begins, and lasts <em>ALL</em> night.</li><li><strong>8th @ 06:40</strong> - Amy's ready to start pushing but the little one turns out to be not so little.</li><li><strong>8th @ 07:45</strong> - <a href="http://www.drprice.com.au/" title="Dr Chris Price">Our obstetrician</a> gets involved because baby is taking too long to appear.</li><li><strong>8th @ 07:52</strong> - We find out that we have a Son! I cut the cord and try to stop crying.</li><li><strong>8th @ 08:30</strong> - Amy is patched up by the Obstetrician and we're left alone to hang with our Son!</li></ul>
I feel the need to say that this was by far and away the most amazing thing I've ever seen. Watching my Son come into the world is something that I'll never forget. I'll also never forget the pain and stress that Amy endured during the birth without reaching for the epidural. Just when I thought I couldn't respect someone any more, she proved me wrong.

For those interested in baby stats:<ul><li><em>Weight</em>: 8lbs 1oz (3.67Kg)</li><li><em>Length</em>: 55cm. Apparently that's about 4cm longer than average. He's a long little tacker!</li><li><em>Head Circumference</em>: 36cm. Ouch! No wonder Amy needed help.</li><li><em>Other info</em>: a full head of hair, very placid, gives Mum and Dad plenty of opportunity to "fix" whatever is wrong before he starts to cry.</li></ul>
I'm the happiest man alive. My wife is amazing, and my Son is a champion. This event has really put a whole new perspective on life, and it really is fantastic.

Now, duty calls. Ciao!
