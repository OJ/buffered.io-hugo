title: Marathon Training Update
---

Since before <a href="/posts/more-punishment/" title="More Punishment">signing up for the marathon</a> I've been making sure that I do my running training regularly. I'm currently doing at least 4 runs during the week, pushing for 5 (all during lunch times). The route that I run around the city is approximately 6.2km, which is a good distance to cover while still having time either side of the run for prepration and showering up so that I don't offend my coworkers.

On top of the 5 runs a week, I have a rest day on Saturday and a long run on Sundays. So far, the long runs aren't as long as I'd like them to be. To date, the reasons have been to me not being fit enough and me not timing my runs to make sure that I have enough daylight to finish them off before it gets dark.

Today I did about 11km in just under 54 mins. I was quite chuffed. Not because it was a blindingly fast run, but because at the end of it I felt amazing! I got home as the sky turned black, but could have easily continued for at least another 5 perhaps 10km. I hope to continue feeling this good as the training progresses. I also really need to get myself a stopwatch/heart monitor so I can get some quality stats on what I'm doing.

While I'm here, time to shout out to a mate otherwise known as "Nugget". Congrats to him on his awesome time for a 10km run down in Sydney today. Great work mate :)
