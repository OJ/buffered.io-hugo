title: Get Away from that Computer!
---

I know I shouldn't laugh about this, but I couldn't help it :)

Any geek that's in a relationship has probably heard the words "GET AWAY FROM THAT <strong>!$@*ING</strong> COMPUTER!" (or something along those lines) more than once. Even if you haven't, you might have heard it from your mum when you were a budding geek (as I was).

After reading <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34990" title="Reiser4 inventor arrested for murder">this article on The Inquirer</a> I couldn't help but think that this bloke had hard that phrase possibly one too many times?!

All joking aside, it's quite shocking to think that someone like this could possibly have done something pretty nasty like this.
