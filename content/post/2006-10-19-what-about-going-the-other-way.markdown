title: What About Going the Other Way?
---

I just thought I'd add this last post as a bit of food for thought before signing off today. This link comes from a bloke who's been through the pain of wanting to move away from Windows, only to find that the results were just as, if not more, painful than sticking to what he knew. Have a read of <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~bederson/user-advocate/2006/09/switchback-horrors-of-windows-power.html" title="HCI User Advocate: Switchback: Horrors of a Windows Power-user Trying to Switch to Apple OS X">this blog entry</a> to see that the grass isn't necessarily greener.

It definitely makes you wonder if the effort is going to be worth it.
