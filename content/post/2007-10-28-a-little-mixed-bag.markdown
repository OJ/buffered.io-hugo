title: A Little Mixed Bag
---

Since the last time I posted a couple of things have happened that are worth mentioning.

First of all, my dear mate <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/" title="Shiftperception">Dan</a> and his lovely girl, Ailin, <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/blog/posts/were-married/" title="We're Married!">got married on the 6th October</a>. It was a fantastic day and I was honoured to be part of it!

Second, I started a new job. A little while ago I received an offer that was too good to miss, and I decided to make the jump. It wasn't an easy decision (it never is), but I do think it's the right one. As usual, I'm not going to mention where I am, nor where I came from. But I can at least pass on a few details.

I now work for a consultancy, and will be spending lots of time on site working directly with clients. The focus is on Microsoft technologies, so I'll be doing a lot more .NET work in the future compared to the last role.

One thing that's interesting about this new role is the requirement to have official <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/default.mspx" title="Microsoft Certifications">Microsoft Certifications</a>, in particular an <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/mcp/mcpd/" title="MCPD">MCPD</a>. So with that in mind, I've leapt back on the study bandwagon to brush up on a few of the basics before taking my first exam. It's nice to get a refresher on a few things that I feel I haven't had the chance to dabble in for quite a while, and it's also nice to learn something new (it feels like it's been quite a while since that's happened).

In my next few posts I'm going to explore some of the areas that I'm now delving into. So if you're interested in anything <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/" title="Microsoft .NET Framework">.NET</a>, <a href="http://wpf.netfx3.com/" title="Windows Presentation Foundation">WPF</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp" title="C#">C#</a> then watch this space. I'm also planning to have a fiddle with <a href="http://silverlight.net/" title="Silverlight">Silverlight</a> in the not too distant future.

Before I depart, I'd just like to share one interesting resource with you. I stumbled across an online <a href="http://www.visitmix.com/university/wpf/wpfbootcamp.htm" title="MIX University - WPF Bootcamp">introduction/bootcamp for WPF that looks quite good</a>! I've watched the first video already which covers a bit of a history of Windows and its user interface, and I found it pretty interesting. I think it's worth checking out. You'll need to install Silverlight to view it though.

Cheers!
