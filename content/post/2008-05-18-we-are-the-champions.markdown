It has been a long time coming (somewhere around the 70 year mark - I think the last time was 1939) but we finally got there. <a href="http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/" title="Portsmouth FC">Pompey</a> made it to the <a href="http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/" title="The FA Cup">FA Cup</a> final. Not only did we get there, but we managed to beat the opposition, Cardiff, <a href="http://www.premierleague.com/page/Headlines/0,,12306~1314532,00.html">1 - 0</a>.

Yes, this is one of the few times I'll ever admit to being born anywhere near Portsmouth ;) It's good to see the lads come up with a win after a pretty good run in the Premier League in the last couple of years. This year we finished 8th, which is great. Hopefully next year we'll continue to improve and get closer to those precious spots that'll allow us to play in Europe.

Well done lads :)
