After shipping the FireFox 2 browser, Mozilla received a present from the IE team at Microsoft. TO take a look, point your browser over <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/firefox-2-boasts-improved-security-and-interface/posts/1161743792256.html" title="Improved security for new Firefox browser - web - Technology - smh.com.au">here</a> and read the story.

If <em>I</em> was a FireFox developer, I'd be <em>veeeeeery</em> wary of taking a bite of that ;) I get the feeling I'd spend the rest of the day on the dunny!
