title: 62 Days To Go
---

I've just come back from another run and again I'm feeling good. I did the same route as yesterday, but 6 minutes slower. It was encouraging that I didn't feel out of breath or overly tired, the thing that got me was sore legs!

Tomorrow is going to be a rest day because I have to go and do a certification exam during lunch time which is a bit annoying. Hopefully Wednesday lunch time I'll be rested up and ready to take on the lunchtime route again. It's tempting to try and beat my best time every time I run, but I should be focussing on keeping my heart rate low.

Now it's time to prep some dinner for the family :)

PS. I do have some geek posts in the works, so don't lose hope!
