title: Real-Time Flight Monitoring
---

I had a read of Eastabrook's blog recently (see a link in the Blogroll) and noticed that he posted about an interesting link that he found.  The link, entitled <a href="http://www.fboweb.com/antest/ge/intro.aspx?old=1" title="Flight Tracking in 3D">Flight Tracking in 3D</a>, shows details of a few downloads that you can grab for <a href="http://earth.google.com/" title="Google Earth">Google Earth</a> which actually show the current locations of <strong>flights that are currently in progress all over the world!!!</strong>

Unbelievable. Pretty amazing technology, and at the same time quite scary. What kind of possible security issues does this feature open up?  I know that Google Earth has had these kinds of questions asked in the past, but this to me seems like it's taking the issue to a whole new level.
