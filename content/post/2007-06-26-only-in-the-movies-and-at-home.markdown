title: Only in the Movies... and at Home.
---

It's an age-old story: boy rings babysitter, boy harasses babysitter over the phone while slowly torturing babysitter's boyfriend and telly babysitter that she's next.

You see this thing in the movies all the time, to the point where it's considered cliched. When the idea of it first came out, it was really quite freaky. Now that it's been done to death, when I see it in a movie I automagically react by turning the movie off.

But seeing the crazy phone behaviour <a href="http://www.engadget.com/posts/stalker-remotely-controls-family-cellphones-even-when-theyre-o/" title="Stalker remotely controls family cellphones, even when theyre off - Engadget">in real life</a>? Now that's pretty freaky!
