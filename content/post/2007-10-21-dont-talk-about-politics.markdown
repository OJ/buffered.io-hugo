title: Don't Talk About Politics
---

I'm about to break a cardinal rule. I'm going to talk about politics (but only briefly). If you're not Australian, or don't have an interest in Australian politics, I'd suggest you give this post a miss :)

Right now I'm sitting in front of the T.V. watching the <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/posts/2060007.htm">Leaders Debate</a>, and I have to say that I'm appalled at some of the utter dribble that is coming out of Kevin Rudd's mouth. The man makes me cringe. He's full of piss and wind, and constantly avoids answering questions. He doesn't really ever say anything of substance. All he seems to do is try and pick holes in the current government. He's an abhorrent little man, and I would be embarrassed to have him lead my country.

Dear God, please don't let Labour win!

PS. I promise I'll never post on politics again! :)
