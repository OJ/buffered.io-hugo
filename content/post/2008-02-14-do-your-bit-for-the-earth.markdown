title: Do your bit for the Earth
---

First post in a while, I guess I must have been busy with something ;) More on that later.

I just thought I'd do my little bit for the world and spread the word about <a href="http://www.earthhour.org/user/0MK7" title="Earth Hour">Earth Hour</a>. Sure it doesn't seem like anything drastic in the grand scheme of things, but every little bit helps. So check it out, sign up and do your bit with me!

Hope you're all doing well. I shall be posting a bit more soon.
