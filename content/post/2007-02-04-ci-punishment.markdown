For a development to succeed in its use of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_Integration" title="Continuous Integration">continuous integration</a> process there must be a sufficiently hefty deterrent to prevent people from breaking the build. If you break the build, you should feel some form of retribution to aid in stopping you from doing it again.

Plip's recently <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/plip/archive/posts/who-broke-the-build.aspx" title="Plip's Weblog : Who broke the build?!">posted a suggestion</a> for this very issue. I think it's a fantastic idea! Make sure you print it and stick it up in your office!
