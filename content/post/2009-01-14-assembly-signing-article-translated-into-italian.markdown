title: Assembly Signing Article Translated into Italian
---

You may remember a little while ago I wrote a post on <a href="/posts/net-fu-signing-an-unsigned-assembly-without-delay-signing/" title=".NET-fu: Signing an Unsigned Assembly (without Delay Signing)">signing assemblies</a> that you don't have the source code to. It got a bit of attention and was reproduced in full on <a href="http://dotnet.dzone.com/news/net-fu-zero-delay-signing-of-a" title=".NET-Fu: Zero Delay Signing Of An Unsigned Assembly">dzone's dotnet site</a>. That was pretty exciting.

This, however, I find <em>more</em> exciting. This article has now been <strong>translated into Italian</strong>! This is the first time an article of mine has been reproduced in another language, which I think is just fantastic.

My colleague, <a href="http://www.otherbit.com/modules/blog/" title="otherbit - New Media & Software">Cosimo</a> has been hard at work making the Italian version for the last couple of weeks. From what I can see it looks like he's done a marvellous job.

So for those of you who are looking for the Italian version of this article, you can find it over <a href="http://www.otherbit.com/modules/blog/BlogContent.aspx?ID=174" title=".NET-FU : come trasformare in SIGNED un assembly UNSIGNED (senza ricorrere al DELAY SIGNING)">here on Cosimo's blog: .NET-FU : come trasformare in SIGNED un assembly UNSIGNED (senza ricorrere al DELAY SIGNING)</a>. Thanks very much Cosimo!

If there's anyone else out there who is interested in translating articles into your home language then please feel free to contact me.

Enjoy!
