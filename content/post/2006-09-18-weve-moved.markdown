title: We've moved!
---

Boy that was quick! I'm sure there's still some DNS servers out there that need to be updated, but things certainly moved quickly. Blackapache is now on a new server, and I'm pretty darned happy with the ease and speed of the move. Not just that, but this new location feels a heck of a lot faster than the old one.

So we're back online! Feel free to continue commenting/posting. I'll be back later (possibly even later today) with some thoughts on episodic gaming.
