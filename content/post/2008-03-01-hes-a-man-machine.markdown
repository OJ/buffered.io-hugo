title: He's a Man-Machine!

<a href="/uploads/2008/03/cimg3576.JPG" title="Matt The Machine Tamsett" rel="lightbox"><img src="/uploads/2008/03/cimg3576.JPG" alt="Matt The Machine Tamsett" width="120" style="border: 0; padding-right: 3px; padding-bottom: 3px; float: left;" /></a>I just wanted to publicly announce some serious kudos to a good mate of mine, Matt Tamsett.  Matt's a bloke I met while working in the games industry in the UK a couple of years back, who now lives in Brisbane too. He's a bit of a fitness freak, and last year decided to sign up for the <a href="http://ironman.com//events/ironman/newzealand/" title="NZ Ironman">Ironman event in New Zealand</a>. For those who don't know, this would have to be <em><strong>the</strong></em> most gruelling Triathlon on the planet (or close to it). It's a huge challenge, and anyone who manages to finish deserves R.E.S.P.E.C.T.

The event kicked off <strong>today</strong> in one of the most stunning parts of the world, <a href="http://www.laketauponz.com/" title="Lake Taupo">Lake Taupo</a>. I'd just got back from an afternoon out with the family when I thought I'd check to see if there was any information on the web about the event in the hope that I'd find out how he was going. In short, he is a man machine!! Finishing in an amazing time, especially for a first-time effort. Some stats:
<ul><li>Swim (2.4 miles): 1:03:44</li><li>Bike (112 miles): 6:05:31</li><li>Run (26.2 miles): 4:07:24</li></ul>Including transition times, that's a total of 11:27:14.  Full details can be found <a href="http://ironman.com//events/ironman/newzealand/?show=tracker&y=2008&race=/events/ironman/newzealand/&bib=439">here</a>. Being able to move for that long is an achievement in itself, let alone in such strenuous conditions.

Matty, if you're out there reading... you are <em>the man</em> :) Congrats on your time, it's an amazing achievement. I look forward to sharing a beer with you when you get back, and I hope your recovery isn't too painful.

I take my hat off to ya! See ya soon :)
