title: Developers vs Programmers
---

Which one are you? I've had my own thoughts on the differences between what makes a person a developer and what makes a person a programmer for some time, but I think <a href="http://www.hacknot.info/hacknot/action/showEntry?eid=90" title="Developers are from Mars, Programmers are from Venus">this article at Hacknot</a> bears a striking resemblance - which means I don't have to write it out myself :)

A great read, and it's something that not only hilights the differences between a lot of people you'll find out there working in the industry, but it'll give an idea of what I believe should be expected of you while you're trying to do your job.
