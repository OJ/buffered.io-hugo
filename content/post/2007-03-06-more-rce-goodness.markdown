title: More RCE Goodness
---

I'm quite excited.  My previous RCE solution and tutorial has been <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/users/cyclops/nts_crackme10/" title="My Solution">approved</a>!

Plus, the first keygenme that I've ever written is now <a href="http://www.crackmes.de/users/thecolonial/thecolonials_keygenme01_x64/" title="My Keygenme">approved and available for download</a>.  So if you're up for a 64-bit RCE challenge, go check it out (or download it directly from <a href="/uploads/2007/03/thecolonial_keygenme01_winx64.zip" title="My Keygenme">here</a>).

Feel free to let me know how good/bad/ugly you think this stuff is!
