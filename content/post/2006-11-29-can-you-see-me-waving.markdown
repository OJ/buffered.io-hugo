title: Can you see me Waving?
---

Hi all! It's been a while since I posted last, but for very good reason. I've been away since the 17th of Nov sorting out various things, packing up and moving south for a short holiday. The reason - I got married!

After over 6 years of being together Amy and I tied the knot on the 24th of Nov '06. The day was an absolute <strong>corker</strong>, and without sounding cliched, it was <em>the</em> best day of my life to date. So if you've been wondering where I am, there's your answer. I'll be posting some pictures up soon for you all to see, but in the mean time it's back to my holidays. I probably won't be back blogging consistently until I get back to the normal daily routine (which includes work :() around the 11th of December. See you all soon!

EDIT: I just noticed that Dan the Man has <a href="http://www.shiftperception.com/blog/posts/oj-wedding/" title="OJ's Wedding">posted a summary and a few photos</a> of the day. They don't include shots of myself or Amy all dressed up, but I'm presuming that's because he's waiting for me to do it ;) Head over there and have a squiz!
