A good friend of mine by the name of <a href="" title=""></a> passed on this little nugget of information through his <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> profile. It reads:<blockquote><p>Apparently Facebook has started letting other websites access user information (surprise, surprise!) to third parties. They call it the "Facebook Development Platform."
To restrict use of your information, do the following:</p><ol><li>Click "Privacy" on top right.</li><li>Under the "Facebook Platform" section click "Edit Settings".</li><li>Scroll down and <strong>UNCHECK ALL</strong> of the items under <em>Facebook Platform</em>.</li></ol><p>Most creepy is the inclusion of photographs!
<em>(Do your friends a favor and repost this as your own note.)</em></p></blockquote>
So, if you're a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> user, do yourself a favour and protect your privacy!
