title: It has begun
---

Those of you who know me will know that I generally feel like I have a lot to say :-) I used to write a diary back in the day, but that was quite some time ago and the site, along with its content, is long since dead. For the last couple of years I've been continually reading people's blogs and found they can be quite insightful. As a geek, I tend to read more geek blogs which cover upcoming technologies, opinions on methodologies and other bits of flotsam and jetsam. The only other blogs I read are by friends of mine who unfortunatley live a long way from me.

So, after a good few years, I've decided to kick my own off again. Yes, it's just another blog. Yes, it's just another collection of ramblings, rants, and uesless trivia. You may find it interesting, funny, bland, boring or all of the above. Feel free to comment on anything I say, as I'm always keen to hear other people's opinions... well, as long as they're the same as mine ;)

Rather than just have a first blog post that is nothing but the standard "Welcome to my blog", I thought I'd at least try and contribute something that you might find interesting... so here it is: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMH0bHeiRNg" title="The Evolution of Dance" target="_blank">The Evolution of Dance</a>.
