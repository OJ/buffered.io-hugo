title: '// TODO: Add Comments'
---

All too often have I seen comments like this. That's if I'm lucky enough to see comments at all! I'm quite a big advocate of comments in code. I don't agree with the age-old philosophy of:<blockquote>If the code was hard to write, it should be hard to read as well!</blockquote>I read a cool article this morning called <a href="http://www.developer.com/design/article.php/3642901" title="In Praise of the Lowly Comment">In Praise of the Lowly Comment</a>, which I think hits the mark nicely. I think I might just email this link around to my current workmates, as I don't think they realise that commenting should consist of more that 'TODO's.
