title: Rotating Banner Pictures
---

Time for another little poll :) This new skin that I've got going has a funky feature which not only randomises the picture at the top of the page, but allows you to have a selection of random pictures that get rotated after a period of time. At the moment, it's set to 3 images which rotate after 15 seconds of being visible and take 4 seconds to change between images.

Is this too much? Does it work? Should I keep the transition effect, or shall I just keep it as a single random image each time a page is loaded?

<strong>Edit:</strong> I've added some more pictures now. Only three are loaded for each page to keep bandwidth down, so if you're really keen you can refresh ;)

All of the pictures I'm uploading are of places in Australia :D
