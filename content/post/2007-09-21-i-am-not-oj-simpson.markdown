title: I am not OJ Simpson
---

In recent weeks I've seen interesting patterns of traffic to the site. I have been trying to figure out exactly what leads people here, but it has been a hard thing to put a finger on (despite the amazing functionality of <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a>). I had a sneaking suspicion for a while that I've been getting hits from those people who are looking for information on OJ Simpson. Two days ago that was confirmed.

I fired up Analytics, and noticed a traffic spike that coincided with the recent arrest of Mr Simpson after his little "meeting" with some thieves. The stats that were listed showed that search engines receiving requests for "oj", "o.j.", etc were dishing up my site as a result.

Let me state for the record: I am <em>not</em> OJ Simpson. But thank you for visiting, and please come again! :)
