title: Server Downtime
---

I'm sure there are millions of adoring fans out there (ha!) that were wondering where the site has been the last few days. Our host, <a href="http://www.vpslink.com/" title="VPSLink">VPSLink</a> had a huge issue with a RAID array being corrupted, and it just so happened that our site was on that node. Such is life!?

The result was a little under two days downtime, and at least a day of extremely poor performance from the site. We're back online now and I'm hoping that the speed issues are going to disappear.

I have a blog post written and raring to go (sitting on my machine at home) that discusses Unity Builds. I was hoping to have that up yesterday but with the server being down it was obviously not going to happen. So watch this space! I shall have it posted when I get home tonight.
