title: N Things You Don't Want to Hear when Starting a New Job (where N &gt;= 1)
---

Here are a collection of quotes that can drive fear into the heart of every developer. They're made worse when heard at the start of a new gig, as any hope of a brave new world is smashed before you even get a login!

<ol>
<li>We are using Agile, but have made a few adjustments.</li>
<li>We need to make some changes to an application in production, but we don't have the source code any more.</li>
<li>How's your Excel/VBA?</li>
<li>We'll worry about testing later.</li>
<li>Make sure you abstract the database layer, just in case we want to switch from SQL 2005 to db4o.</li>
<li>We make heavy use of enterprise design patterns, especially inversion of control and dependency injection. We don't want to be tightly coupled to <em>anything</em>.</li>
<li>We have a Biztalk license.</li>
<li>In the interim, can you please work on these reports?</li>
<li>We use the latest and greatest technology, such as SQL 2000 and .NET v1.1.</li>
<li>We have written our own framework and code generator.</li>
<li>Have you ever written any Cobol?</li>
<li>We have the work but it hasn't been approved yet.</li>
<li>We use VSS 6.0 for Version Control. -- <em>Inspired by M Princz (below)</em></li>
<li>All testing is done by the BAs. -- <em>Inspired by M Princz (below)</em></li>
<li>We're using Great Plains for timesheets.</li>
<li>We've got a stack of 3rd party UI controls that we don't use any more, but we have to link them in otherwise the back-end code breaks. -- <em>Inspired by JoCo</em></li>
</ol>
There are lots more, but I've forgotten them. I'll be sure to add them as I remember.

... any suggestions?
