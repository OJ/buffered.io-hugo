title: F# Presentation Tomorrow
---

It seems that the Gods have finally smiled upon me. They have answered my request to work with smart people! I am currently fortunate enough to be working with a few Guns who are well-known in the industry. Rather than mention all of them, I'm just going to focus on one who for now happens to be in line with my current "theme" of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming" title="Functional programming">functional programming</a> posts.

The well-respected <a href="http://www.secretgeek.net/" title="secretGeek">secretGeek</a>, also known as <a href="http://www.secretgeek.net/about.asp" title="About 'secretGeek'">Leon Bambrick</a>, is going to be giving an <a href="http://www.secretgeek.net/fsharp_eye.asp" title="F# eye for the C# guy">introductory talk</a> on the <a href="" title="F#">F# language</a> tomorrow night, Tuesday 18th March at 6pm. If you're keen to go, best check out the link and register your interest. It'll no doubt be a great presentation by someone who's not only smart but a bloody nice chap to boot.

If you have time, make sure you tag along. You won't regret it! I might even see you there if I can shake this damned cold!
