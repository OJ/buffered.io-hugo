title: Server change imminent
---

In the next couple of days Blackapache is going to be shifting to a new server. There are a few reasons for this, but the main one is the fact that I'm frustrated and unimpressed with the level of service I'm getting with the current provider. I'm not going to directly state who it is, but it's pretty easy to find it out ;)

I'll be moving my site, and a couple of others, to a server here in Australia where the speed and quality of service is substantially higher thanks to <a href="http://www.netlogistics.com.au/" title="NetLogistics">NetLogistics</a>. There may be a little bit of down-time during the move (which I'm not keen on, but there's nothing I can do about it - curse you, DNS). So please bear with me while the move is made. I hope we'll be back up and running pretty soon.

Cheers, and don't go anywhere, we'll be back after these short messages.... :)
