title: Google Code Search
---

The Search Kings have come up with another rippin' tool which allows you to crawl through source code for examples and whatnot. The <a href="http://google.com/codesearch" title="Code Search">Google Code Search</a> is quite a cool utility - but it doesn't come without it's issues. I found an interesting link worthy of reading which talks about a few <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/10/google-code-search">amusing results</a> returned from this facility, which I reckon lots of people should check out and be aware of.

So this begs the question: Is this going to be a tool which allows hackers to get acceess to bugs in software a heck of a lot quicker? I believe so. Is that a bad thing? No, I don't think so. In fact, it'll teach developers (the hard way) that they need to be aware of security issues well before they release the code - which can only be a good thing as it should have a positive affect on the software.

As a small side note, there can also be some <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/posts/code_outrage/" title="Apple in code search profanity outrage">embarrassing snippets</a> revealed which will make the big names cringe. So, maybe this will also teach developers to be a little more professional!
