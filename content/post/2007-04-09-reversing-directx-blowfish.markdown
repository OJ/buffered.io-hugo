title: Reversing DirectX & Blowfish
---

This tutorial has been on the boil for quite a while.  I got close to nailing the problem late last month, but didn't end up finding the time to finish it until this weekend.  This tutorial is a solution to another Crackme, but this time it's really not for the faint-hearted.  Information on reversing fullscreen [DirectX (Direct3D)][D3D] applications and playing around with [Blowfish][] can be found in this tutorial, and it's a bit of a mind-job - it also weighs in at nearly 40 pages (with some nice pictures thrown in)!

Take a look at the [Crackme][] and then [my solution][Solution]. Enjoy.

### Update: 9th Feb 2012 ###

This tutorial was originally posted and hosted on [Crackmes.de](http://www.crackmes.de/) alongside the crackme itself. Unfortunately Crackems.de had been taken offline for quite a while for legal reasons and hence the tutorial wasn't available there.

Thanks to issues with webhosts and backup failures, this tutorial was completely unavailable for a long time. Thankfully that site is back up now and I finally have a copy of the tutorial again.

You can still reference the material over on that [site](http://www.crackmes.de/users/silver/silvers_dx_crackme_1/), but I have decided to host a copy of it here as well.
