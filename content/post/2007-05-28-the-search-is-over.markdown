title: The Search is Over
---

I now have an answer to the question that I implied in my <a href="/posts/the-search-might-be-over/" title="The Search Might be Over">previous post</a> (ie. is the search over?)! The answer is: <strong>Yes! The search is over!</strong>

I'm not going to go into all the gory and graphic details (this is, after all, a publicly viewable blog), but I can say that after a single round of negotiation with the owner of the said block of land, we've settled on a price and we're in the throws of getting it sorted out. It's very exciting! We've got a fairly standard contract as far as property exchanges go in Queensland, and we're aiming to settle within 30 days (even though our contract gives us 45 days to settle).

We're both extremely happy with the purchase (despite the debt we've now got ourselves into), and we're hoping for smooth sailing through to the conclusion of the contract. When soil tests are done, banks are happy with the finance, and the contract all goes through swimmingly, I'll post again to let you know that it's officially ours.

In the mean time, here's a dot for you to look at ----->   .

Cheers!
