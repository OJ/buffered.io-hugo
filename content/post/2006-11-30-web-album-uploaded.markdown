title: Web Album Uploaded

I thought I'd best get in quickly before all the emails start coming in asking "<em>where are the $*^ING PHOTOS!??!</em>" and get a web album up so that you guys can all see evidence of the amazing time that I've had over the last couple of weeks.

I've used Picassa and the Google web album feature to get a stack of pictures up, and you can find them all <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/thecolonial/" title="OJ and Amy's Wedding - 24th Nov '06">here</a>. I'll be posting again in a while and letting you all know about the good, the bad and the ugly with regards to getting our wedding organised.

EDIT 2: Rob the Grey has <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/robertgreyling" title="OJ and Amy's Wedding">joined the frey!</a>

EDIT 3: Mr Yes No has also decided to <a href="http://picasaweb.google.co.uk/yesnaud/OliverAmyWedding"  title="OJ and Amy's Wedding">stick his $0.02 worth in.</a>
