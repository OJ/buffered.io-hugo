title: Farewell to an Australian Games Industry Icon
---

I received a bit of sad news from "He who must not be named" this morning. It appears that Aussie game developer <a href="http://www.auran.com/" title="Auran">Auran</a> are <a href="http://kotaku.com/gaming/rumor/auran-on-life-support-330643.php" title="Auran on Life-Support">struggling to stay afloat</a>, and will most likely close. This isn't good news for the Aussie contingent of the games industry, and is an indication of how cut-throat the industry can be.

But let's be honest, while it's sad to hear that they're in strife, it isn't really a <em>surprise</em>.<!--more-->

Before I went to the UK for a couple of years (partly to get a foot in the door of the games industry) I had contacted Auran many times. A few times I had been told that I was going to have an interview for a programming position. This would be followed up with them putting recruitment on hold while the company restructures and sorts itself out. Afterwards, they decide not to take on anyone without any experience in the industry. It was a frustrating time for me as a budding game developer, but I took it on the chin.

Having an interest in the games industry, I continued to monitor everything that happened to the Australian games companies. One thing that was almost constant was that Auran were always struggling to come up with good titles, and they consistanly under-delivered. Their titles (such as <a href="http://www.auran.com/trainz/" title="Trainz">Trainz</a>) were just plain boring. The quality was sub-standard. They shipped their titles late. These were clear signs that they were struggling.

There were also evidence that grants from the government were also helping them stay alive - another sign of desparation. Obviously the funds from the sales of the games weren't enough to sustain them.

Of course, I am partially speculating I have never worked for Auran, but from the rumblings around the web and their recent history it's pretty easy to conclude that all wasn't well.

Then they released <a href="http://www.unleashthefury.com/" title="Fury">Fury</a>, an all-singing all-dancing MMO. It hasn't really been received well. Due to its poor performance, Auran are telling its employees to start looking for other work. It's amazing that a company that came out with something as amazing as <a href="http://www.auran.com/games/darkreign/default.htm" title="Dark Reign">Dark Reign</a> back in 1997 could end up in this situation.

So, sad I am to see it happen. Surprised, I am not. If anything, I am surprised that they have managed to last so long in an industry which is incredibly unforgiving. One amazing game isn't enough to keep a game company alive.

I'm also surprised to see people comment on stories like this and say things like:<blockquote><p>Your studio releases one sub-par game and you're looking for another job... which using means moving halfway across the country or to another country entirely.</p></blockquote><strong>One</strong> sub-par game? Come on. What about Trainz Classics, Trainz Driver, Trains 2004/2006? They all sucked. Bridge IT had potential, but again never really gained a foothold. Other than Dark Reign, you can't really say much for Auran's portfolio.

As a parting note, I'd like to send out a (potentially harsh) shot to the Australian games industry: It's time to raise the bar! Let's focus on game <strong>quality</strong>. Let's stop pretending that we're playing with the big boys when we're <strong>not</strong>. We've got some of the brightest minds in the industry working for us, and some amazing gaming talent out there. We can do so much more than we're currenlty doing. A few one-hit-wonders isn't convincing enough! If we're going to stay alive in this industry we have no choice.

All flames welcome :)

PS. Before you ask, no I don't currently work in the games industry :D
