title: 'Shortcuts: Windows'
---

This is the first of a collection of posts that I'm going to be making about shortcuts in applications. I'm constantly on the lookout for keyboard shortcuts to aid in improving the speed of my day to day activities, and I thought it'd be a good idea to start sharing them with you. These posts will probably get edited a few times over the course of their lives as I find more shortcuts :)

Below is a list of shortcuts that I use for generally getting around Windows. Note that when I refer to the <em>WIN</em> key I am referring to the Windows/Start key that lies between <em>CTRL</em> and <em>ALT</em> on the keyboard. Most of these shortcuts will work regardless of the application you're currently using as these shortcuts are 'unwritten laws'. Some of these are pretty obvious, but I'll stick them in anyway. Some of them might be XP specific, but most of them will work regardless of the Windows version.
<ul>
<li><strong>WIN + E</strong> - Open a new Windows File Explorer window.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + R</strong> - Open the 'Run' dialog.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + F</strong> - Open a new Windows Search/Find window.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + U</strong> - Open the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/accessibility/openutilitymanager.mspx" title="Windows Utility Manager">Utility Manager</a> (most people don't even know this exists!).</li>
<li><strong>WIN + M</strong> - Minimise all windows.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + SHIFT + M</strong> - Restore all windows to the state they were in before pressing <em>WIN + M.</em></li>
<li><strong>WIN + D</strong> - Toggles minimise/restore in the same way that <em>WIN + M</em> and <em>WIN + SHIFT + M</em> do.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + Pause/Break</strong> - Open the System Properties dialog.</li>
<li><strong>WIN + L</strong> - Lock the workstation.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + ALT + DEL</strong> - If logged in to your machine as a domain user, this will bring up a user options dialog which allows you to change password, lock workstation, etc. If logged into a home machine that is not part of a domain this will invoke the Windows Task Manager.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + ESC</strong> - Open the Start menu (handy for those without a Windows key).</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + SHIFT + ESC</strong> - Open the Windows Task Manager.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + TAB</strong> - Cycle through applications.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + SHIFT + TAB</strong> - Cycle through applications in the other direction.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + TAB</strong> - Cycle through any tabs in the current application (eg. Firefox).</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + SHIFT + TAB</strong> - Cycle through any tabs in the current application in the other direction.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + SPACE + N</strong> - Minimise the current window.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + SPACE + X</strong> - Maximise the current window.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + SPACE + M</strong> - Move the current window.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + F4</strong> - Close the current document/tab.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + F4</strong> - Close the current application.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + C</strong> - Copy the current folder/file/text/image/etc to the clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + X</strong> - Cut the current folder/file/text/image/etc to the clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + V</strong> - Paste the current folder/file/text/image/etc from the clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + Z</strong> - Undo.</li>
<li><strong>CTRL + Y</strong> - Redo.</li>
<li><strong>Print Scrn</strong> - Take a screenshot of the entire desktop (including open Windows) and store it on the clipboard.</li>
<li><strong>ALT + Print Scrn</strong> - Take a screenshot of the current window.</li>
</ul>

Now we're past the shortcuts, I'd also like to show you some of the other commands that I frequently punch into the 'Run' dialog (<em>WIN + R</em>) to quickly launch to applications instead of using the Start menu.
<ul>
<li><strong>services.msc</strong> - Open the Windows Services dialog.</li>
<li><strong>compmgmt.msc</strong> - Open the Computer Management dialog. This is great as it has all the bits that you need to manage your machine, such as IIS, Services, Security, etc.</li>
<li><strong>eventvwr</strong> - Open the Windows Event Log viewer.</li>
<li><strong>iisreset</strong> - Reset IIS (if you have it installed).</li>
<li><strong>cmd</strong> - Open a command prompt.</li>
<li><strong>msconfig</strong> - Open the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/msconfig_usage.mspx" title="System Configuration Utility">System Configuration Utility</a>.</li>
<li><strong>calc</strong> - Open the Windows Calculator.</li>
<li><strong>notepad</strong> - See if you can figure this one out yourself ;).</li>
<li><strong><em>drive:\path\to\folder</em></strong> - Open a Windows File Explorer window at the specified location.</li>
<li><strong>mspaint</strong> - Open MS Paint for quick creation of images files from screen captures.</li>
</ul>

There the ones I can think of at the moment, if I think of some more I'll add them. Please give me a shout if you use one that I haven't mentioned!
