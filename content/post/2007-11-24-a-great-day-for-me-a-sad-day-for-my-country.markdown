title: A Great Day for Me, a Sad Day for my Country
---

<a href="/uploads/2007/11/img.jpg" title="The Big Day" rel="lightbox"><img src="/uploads/2007/11/img.jpg" alt="The Big Day" class="InlineImageLeft" Width="100" /></a>Let's start with the good news. Today is my first ever wedding anniversary! This last year seems to have <em>flown</em> by. In many ways it feels like I got married a few weeks ago, and yet in other ways it feels like so much has happened.

It really has been an amazing year. I'm an extremely lucky man and honestly couldn't be happier. I won't get too sooky, but I just wanted to say that my wife makes my life complete. One year down, <strong>many</strong> more to go!

On a sad note, today our Government changed and the ALP are now in power. I've already mentioned that I despise Rudd the dickhe... I mean ministers that work with him. The thought of giving Wayne Swann the job of managing the economy just makes me sick to the stomach. I just hope that I'm wrong about Kevin, and that he's actually going to do a good job. By the same token, I hope he can't do much damage in the next three years while he's in office.
