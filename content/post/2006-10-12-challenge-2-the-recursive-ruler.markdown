title: 'Challenge #2 - The Recursive Ruler'
---

I posted this problem a little while ago on the site I used to run, and it proved to be an interesting one that resulted in quite a large collection of solutions from the posters. So here it is again.

Your job is to write a program that generates a text-based ruler. For a clearer definition of what I mean, see the little text pic below:

```
|                               |                               |
|               |               |               |               |
|       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |
|||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
```

The user of the program must be able to specify a couple of parameters: those being the <em>height</em> of the ruler and the <em>number of sections</em> in the ruler (at the top level).  In the above example, the values would be <strong>6</strong> and <strong>2</strong> respectively.  Another example, using the values <strong>3</strong> and <strong>3</strong> would result in:

```
|   |   |   |
| | | | | | |
|||||||||||||
```

The only other thing that you have to do is make sure that your solution uses <strong><u>recursion</u></strong> instead of iteration.  Feel free to use any language you want, you can write to screen or to file, it's your call. But you <strong>must</strong> use recursion.

I look forward to seeing your responses. :) Happy coding!
