title: More Punishment
---

After more than 3 years on the bench I've decided to take the plunge again. Today I signed up for the <a href="http://www.goldcoastmarathon.com.au/" title="Gold Coast Airport Marahon">Gold Coast Airport Marathon</a>. The event will be held on the 6th July '08 -- which from today means I have a total of 80 more days to prepare.

I've been back into running training for a few weeks now, and have been really enjoying it. Lunch time runs are really helping since I don't have a great deal of time in the evenings to run.

<!--more-->

As of next week I'll be aiming for 7km runs at lunchtimes for all 5 working days. I'll take a rest-day on Saturday to hang with the family, and I'll be aiming for a longer run on Sunday afternoons -- probably around the 20 to 25km mark.

It's exciting and scary knowing that I'll be putting myself through hell again, but I am looking forward to it. It can't possibly be harder than the <a href="http://www.connemarathon.com/" title="Connemarra Marathon - Ireland">last one I did</a>. After all this one is flat and shouldn't be freezing temperatures.

Wish me luck guys! And feel free to join me on the big day if you're up for it :)
