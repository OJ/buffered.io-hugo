Here's a brief list of what's coming down the pipe on this blog in the coming weeks. I thought I'd post this info as I've had a few people ask what's up next and I'm tired of telling the same story over and over :) So here it is!

<!--more-->
<ol>
<li><a href="/posts/sorting-things-out/" title="Sorting things Out">Sorting</a> - Yes this series is still very much alive. I am working through the content of the post on the Quick Sort algorithm. It's quite a tricky algorithm to describe <em>well</em> while not being overly confusing or using too much jargon. Most of the work that I am doing here is around trying to make the information easier to digest. After that, there are still many other algorithms that I'll be covering.</li>
<li>Debugging .NET in Production Environments - Experience and skill in this area is surprisingly rare. I've had a bit of experience with it, but was inspired by <a href="http://www.acorns.com.au/Blog/" title="Parallel Thinking">Corneliu's</a> Tech.Ed AU 08 presentation to take some time to blog about it. A few posts are in the pipe which I hope will aid in exposing the innards of this "black art".</li>
<li>Thoughts on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/beta-download.aspx" title="Download Windows 7 Beta">Windows 7 Beta</a> - I'll be installing this shortly and playing with it a fair bit over the coming weeks. No doubt I'll have a few things to say. My goal isn't to list features, like so many other sites, but to talk about my views on usability, stability and performance.</li>
<li>Thoughts on <a href="http://www.ndepend.com/" title="NDepend">NDepend</a> - This is a tool that I've read up on but have never used. I have a pro license now and am ready to give it a good run. I'll be posting my thoughts down the track when I feel I'm at a point where I can give a solid appraisal.</li>
<li><a href="http://projecteuler.net/" title="Project Euler">Project Euler</a> solutions - Yes I'm still working through them. It's hard to find the time to go through them at the rate that I used to, but I still do them from time to time. Yes I'm still using <a href="http://haskell.org/" title="Haskell">Haskell</a>, and yes I'll be posting the source in the hope that someone can point out how bad it is and help me learn more. The next post will cover the solution to <a href="http://projecteuler.net/index.php?section=problems&id=11" title="Problem 11">problem 11</a>. I've got two different approaches that I will be talking about as I found both of the fun and interesting.</li>
<li>Some "niche" posts - That is, posts which hit a specific point of pain (such as the <a href="/posts/net-fu-signing-an-unsigned-assembly-without-delay-signing/" title=".NET-fu: Signing an Unsigned Assembly (without Delay Signing)">assembly signing</a> post) but aren't the run-of-the-mill post containing information or value that can be utilised every day. The goal is to share bits of info which might only be useful once in a blue moon, but you're grateful for knowing it when you do need it!</li>
<li>Random bits and pieces - Whatever else takes my fancy or pops up along the way.</li>
</ol>

My aim is to get a good mix of stuff on here to make it enjoyable for a big audience.

Suggestions are also welcome ;)
