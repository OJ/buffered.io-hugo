title: A Crack in the Vista
---

I'm sure that everyone knew that this was going to happen at some stage. Whether or not they believed it'd happen so quickly is another matter. Either way, it's official, the new wonderdumpling operating system from Microsoft has been cracked. Aparently the activation and installation of the whole thing has been bypassed, and it's available on the web. Check out <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/biztech/vista-gold-but-cracked-already/posts/1163266532925.html" title="Vista gold but cracked already - BizTech - Technology - smh.com.au">this SMH article</a> for more information.

Why do they bother? Microsoft's software is always going to be a target for hackers and crackers, and I think it'd be a better use of time and resources if they focussed on improving the user experience and giving the user more control and power when using the OS instead of trying to labotomise the machine if the software is cracked (and hence causing a crapload of problems for <em>legit</em> users) then they'd find that their users would be happier and they wouldn't end up with so much egg on the face!
