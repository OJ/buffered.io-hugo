* I'm just another security guy trying to make the world a better place, one hack at a time.
* I help out a bit with [Metasploit and Meterpreter](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework).
* I'm a proud member of the [Corelan team](https://www.corelan.be).
* I've managed to acquire [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/) and [OSCE](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/osce-offensive-security-certified-expert/) certifications.
* I run a specialist security consultancy called [Beyond Binary](https://beyondbinary.io/).
