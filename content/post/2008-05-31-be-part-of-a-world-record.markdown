Get yourself a copy of Firefox 3 on the day it's released <a href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/en-US/worldrecord/" title="Firefox 3">from this site</a> and you'll be doing your bit to get Firefox downloads in the world record books.

Yup, you'll also be falling for a huge marketing gag designed to get Firefox installed on as many machines as possible, but it's a damned good browser anyway, so no harm done! :)
