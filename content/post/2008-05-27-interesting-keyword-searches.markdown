title: Interesting Keyword Searches
---

I was browsing through my <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics" title="Google Analytics">Google Analytics</a> stats earlier and thought it'd be interesting to browse through search terms that resulted in a hit on my site.

Man, there are some crazy entries!

<!--more-->

Here's a list of some of my favourites:
<ul>
<li><em>"break the build" punishment</em> - Good to see people taking the hard line on build breakers.</li>
<li><em>"good code"</em> - Yeah like you'll find any of that here.</li>
<li><em>"when they play in their garden"</em> - WTF?</li>
<li><em>camera keeps dropping out of Skype</em> - Just keeping putting it back in.</li>
<li><em>code to add a spade to your writing</em> - I would love to see that code.</li>
<li><em>fartfox</em> - This hit makes sense because I have actually <a href="/posts/get-fartfox/">written about this</a>, but why would someone search for it?!</li>
<li><em>getroman</em> - That's my superhero name.</li>
<li><em>optus bastards</em> - You got that right!</li>
<li><em>yoooooootube</em></li>
</ul>I'm amazed that some of those searches ended up here.

The Internet is one crazy place ;)
