title: What are you Really Eating?
---

It's been a very long time since I last ate fast food (such as McDonalds, KFC or Hungry Jacks). In fact, it's been <em>years</em>, because I just can't stand the stuff and I know it's really bad for me.

When it comes to other types of junk I'm pretty good. The only time I ever eat potato chips is when my mate Mike pops round and brings them with him. I never buy them myself, and they don't make it into our shopping cart when we buy groceries.  I never eat doughnuts any more. I don't remember the last doughnut that I ate, that's how long ago it was.

So, you can probably imagine how happy I was that my junk food habits are very minimal (chocolate being the only contender, and even that doesn't make a frequent appearance) when Amy sent a link to me <a href="http://vitalvotes.com/blogs/public_blog/More-Reasons-to-Avoid-Potato-Chips-4439.aspx" title="">describing some stuff that happens during potato chip/doughnut manufacture</a>. In essense, eating this kind of junk food is horrendously bad for you.

If it's not good for a biodiesel car engine, how can it be good for the human body?
