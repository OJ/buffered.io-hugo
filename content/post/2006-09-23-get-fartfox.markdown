title: Get FartFox
---

<img style="float: right; padding-left: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px" src="http://images.vnu.net/gb/inquirer/news/posts/firefoxs-japanese-logo-in-gas-attack/burntarse.bmp" width="200" alt="FartFox" />I came across some info on <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/default.aspx?article=34574" title="Firefox's Japanese logo in gas attack">The Inquirer</a> earlier today regarding Firefox's logo (shown on the right) that's being used for the Japanese version.  As the link above states:<blockquote>The new logo for its Japanese Fire Fox, Foxkeh, was apparently chosen out of a field of 600.</blockquote>How could they not see the issue with the image before releasing it to the world?

Not that it matters ;) I like the logo - it implies that Firefox is <em>shit hot</em>, which I think it is :)
