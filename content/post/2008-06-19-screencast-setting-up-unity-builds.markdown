title: Screencast - Setting up Unity Builds
---

It has taken me a bit longer than expected, but I've finally got the screencast up!

That's right folks, my angelic voice is now online for you all to experience. 8 minutes of Unity Build glory!

I made the screencast using the demo version of <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.asp" title="Camtasia">Camtasia</a> (which I give a big thumbs up to!). It weighs in at around 19MB in total, but it's well worth watching if you haven't seen a Unity Build in action before. Remember to check out <a href="/posts/the-magic-of-unity-builds/" title="The Magic of Unity Builds">The Magic of Unity Builds</a> if you want some more technical information on how these builds work.

The project and associated source code that I used for this screencast is available for download <a href="/uploads/2008/06/win32wrap.zip" title="Old code, but it's great for the demo">right here</a>.

As a final note, please forgive me for sounding tired!

I look forward to hearing your feedback. Enjoy!
