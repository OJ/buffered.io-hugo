<img src="/uploads/2010/06/Home.png" alt="Erlang Logo" style="float:right; margin-left:5px; margin-bottom: 5px;"/>The time has come for another meeting of the Functional Programming minds! This months <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group-BFG/calendar/12636552/" title="June BFPG Meetup">BFPG Meetup</a>, starting 6pm Monday 28th, is the first one at our new venue: Microsoft HQ, Waterfront Place, Brisbane. For details on the location, take a look at the <a href="http://bfpg.org/about/" title="About BFPG">BFPG about page</a>.

In my talk, "Erlang - Why should you care?", I will be giving a fairly non-technical introduction to <a href="http://erlang.org/" title="Erlang">Erlang</a>. I'll be covering off the features of the language, some of its design goals and its history. I aiming to show that this language is not one that was spawned out of academia and that it has been applied in the real-world ever since its conception. If I have time, I'll also be giving a small demonstration of one of the neatest features of the technology.

I'll be posting the slides and demonstration code here on this blog as well as <a href="http://bfpg.org/" title="BFPG">BFPG's home</a> after the meetup has taken place.

Myself and my comrades, <a href="http://adams.id.au/blog/" title="Nosewheelie">Tom</a> and <a href="http://blog.tmorris.net/" title="Tony's blog">Tony</a>, will aim to provide a fun and interesting evening at our new venue. Based on the RSVPs so far, it looks like we are going to have one of the biggest turn-outs to date. This is probably due to the exposure we got during last month's <a href="/posts/dave-thomas-at-yow-nights-brisbane/" title="Dave Thomas at YOW! Nights Brisbane">talk by Dave Thomas</a>. There are still plenty of spots left, so if you're keen to come along, <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Brisbane-Functional-Programming-Group-BFG/calendar/12636552/" title="Sign up for BFPG June 10">go and sign up</a>. Bring your friends, your friend's friends and your mum.

I hope to see you there!

<strong>Update (6th July 2010):</strong> We had a fantastic turn-out of just short of 50 people (a record breaker for the group so far!). My talk seemed to be fairly well-received. No rotten tomatoes were thrown and the crowd seemed engaged through most of the talk. It felt good! I think many people wanted to see more code, but since that wasn't the focus of the talk they were a little disappointed. If people are keen for more Erlang goodness at future meetups, then I'll be happy to dive a little deeper.

Here's a video of my talk:
