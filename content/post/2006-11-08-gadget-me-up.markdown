The guys over at <a href="http://www.slickedit.com/" title="SlickEdit">SlickEdit.com</a>, makers of the top notch SlickEdit editor, have released a stack of free <a href="http://www.slickedit.com/content/view/441" title="SlickEdit - SlickEdit Gadgets for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005">gadgets for Visual Studio 2005</a> which are free! (I love that word.. I'm going to say it again.. FREEEEE).

The freebies include:
<ul><li>Editor Gadgets (Line ruler, Indentation guide, Auto-copy selection, Editor Graphic)</li><li>The Command Spy</li><li>File Explorer</li><li>Data Object Analyser</li><li>The SLOC Report</li></ul>It's a nice collection of tools if you ask me!
