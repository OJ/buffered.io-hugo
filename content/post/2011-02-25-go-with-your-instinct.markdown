title: Go With Your Instinct
---

<a href="/uploads/2011/02/double-facepalm.jpg" rel="lightbox"><img src="/uploads/2011/02/double-facepalm.jpg" width="150" style="float:left;margin-right:5px;margin-bottom:5px;" /></a>At an early age I realised that it's not always a bad thing to go with your first instinct. I won't go into the reasons here, nor the way I came to that conclusion. What I will say is that I wish I'd listened to my inner-8-year-old-self when I started down the thread of emails and Tweets you're about to read.

Suffice is to say that I have learned my lesson!

The thread speaks for itself. Enjoy :)

<p>Shame. All that was in the doc was a very blurry and hard to read image with a stack trace that I can't read.</p>

Sorry to hear of your issues. The image that you have sent me is extremely poor quality and I'm unable to read it. <br />
Please send a screenshot as a PNG/JPG or just copy and paste the text into an email. Don't use word.<br />

Don't uninstall word. I'm asking you to send me the stack trace in a form that I can read!<br />

Just paste the text of the error into an email directly<br />

Thank you. You are right! Even uninstall word cannot fix of the site.<br />
My normal word is the linux. I cannot find to send you the stack trace in a form. What form is it? <br />

Alwyn,<br />
<br />
Make sure you read what I am saying, and read it properly. I never once told you to uninstall Word, I just told you not to use it to send me the details of your issue.<br />
<br />
Citrix shouldn't stop you from copying and pasting, but if it does, take a screenshot like you did before and open "Paint". you should find it in the "accessories menu". when you've opened paint, paste the screenshot in there, and save the image as a jpg, png or bmp. Then attach that to an email and send it to me.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I am not giving out fax or skype details. Trust me, you're getting way more out of this than you deserve.<br />

12:1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, 2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.<br />
