Yes, another obscure and extremely useful postback. Bow down to the ultimate in WTFs!!!
{% codeblock lang:csharp %}
protected void OnCheckedChanged( object sender, EventArgs e)
{
	// Dummy for disabled checkboxes in lists
}
{% endcodeblock %}

It's a beauty! I guess I should at least be grateful that there's a comment in there.

WTFness: Has to be 10 / 10.

PS - My good mate Dan is going to help me create a WTF-o-meter which you guys can vote on! That should make it interesting :)
