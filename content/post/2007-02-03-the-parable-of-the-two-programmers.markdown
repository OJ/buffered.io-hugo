title: The Parable of the Two Programmers
---

Another short snippet this morning. I wanted to inform you of a fairly old-skool story; one that lots of developers will already know about. It's a great tale, and still holds a lot of truth for today's world of I.T. despite it being very old.

Have a read of the tale - <a href="http://www.csd.uwo.ca/staff/magi/personal/humour/Computer_Audience/The%20Parable%20of%20the%20Two%20Programmers.html" title="The Parable of the Two Programmers">The Parable of the Two Programmers</a>.

Which one are you? :)
