Yup, it's absolutely, positively disgusting :) And yes, it highlights my artistic abilities. Well, actually, it highlights my lack of motivation to actually come up with something coo so I instead hacked out the existing text and threw in something else. I know it's horrid :) I'm waiting patiently for me main man Dan to come up with something groovey that I can use instead - so this will have to do in the mean time.

Feel free to abuse me in any way you see fit!
