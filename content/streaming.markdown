title: Live Streaming
---

In an effort to help dispel the myth that many security people are able to break things without trying or thinking, I decided to start live-streaming my desktop while doing various security-related things. The aim is to show that:

1. I am stupid. I don't know what I am doing! It's ok if you don't either!
1. Security stuff is tricky, finnicky, and frustrating. It's also awesome fun, when it all finally comes together.
1. Attacking binaries, web applications, or infrastructure from an offensive security perspective is an ongoing process of exploration and repeated failure. It doesn't just magically happen.
1. We can all learn something from each other, especially when we're failing!

I will also spend some time on development as well, probably with a focus on (but not limited to) Metasploit and Meterpreter.

Hopefully you get a kick out of watching. Thanks for supporting the idea.

## Suggestions

Do I take suggestions for streams? Absolutely! [Hit me up](/contact/) with whatever it is you'd like to see, and I will do my best to accommodate you.

## Rules

If you're going to come along and watch the streams while they're being recorded, please note the following rules:

* Don't be a dick to people. It won't be tolerated. Multiple moderators are present in the chat during the streams, and you'll be banned without a second chance if you turn nasty, troll, or don't show respect to fellow viewers.
* I have no problem with swearing (I do a bit myself!), but don't direct it at people. Use it in jest or frustration, but keep it sane.
* Please ask questions as we go. It's easier to answer them in context than to do it all at the end. I periodically check the chat to see what questions are coming up, so don't be shy.

## Music

In the past I liked to play [Gai Barone](https://soundcloud.com/gai-barone) via SoundCloud while streaming as I think it's cool music that fits the vibe. However, thanks to licensing concerns, I've had to switch. These days I make good use of a [Monstercat Gold](https://www.monstercat.com/gold) subscription.
