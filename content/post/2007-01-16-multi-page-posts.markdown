As you no doubt have guessed, I can be a little verbose from time to time as I'm ranting away ;) So I pondered the possibility of breaking up my posts across multiple pages.  I installed a plugin that allows me to break the single post up into a series of pages, and I was on the verge of using it for the first time a couple of posts ago when I thought it might not be a good idea.

The issue I have with it is that it <em>might</em> be a deterrant to people who are reading. So I came up with a list of pros and cons during the course of investigating the options.

Pros:<ul><li>Reduces bandwidth usage - By breaking the posts up into smaller pages the amount of information I'm serving up is considerably less in the cases where people don't want to read the whole lot, or where they've already read the whole lot. This is not just good for the user who might be limited by downloads or speed, but good for me as it reduces the amount of information I serve up.</li><li>Reduces fright - Seeing a small amount of text makes it a lot less daunting to read than being faced with one <strong>huge</strong> page of text.</li><li>It looks cool :).</li></ul>
Cons:<ul><li>Readers aren't immediately aware of how much they're going to have to read.</li><li>Can be daunting if there's a large number of pages.</li></ul>

That's really all I could come up with :) I'm leaning towards using them from now on when my posts get big, but I'm still not 100% sure. What do you guys think?
