title: A Software List is Not a Job Description
---

Over the past few weeks I've had the joy of dealing with many recruitment agents as I've been looking for a new contract.  I won't get into the choice of job at this stage, as that's a whole new blog post right there.  What I wanted to show was my frustration at quality of most of the job advertisements I see on the Internet.

To sum up:<ul><li>They generally have a lot of spelling and grammatical errors.</li><li>They highlight the lack of technical knowledge that the recruitment agent actually has.</li><li>They contain a badly formatted list of "skills", which generally aren't skills at all.</li><li>They almost always have no indication of the salary/rate.</li></ul>On top of this, you also get the posts that:<ul><li>List the details of a permanent job in an attempt to get contractors to apply for them.</li><li>List the details of a job in a completely different location to the one that you want in the hope that when you apply they can convince you to relocate.</li></ul>IMHO, this kind of behaviour is taking the piss. It's no wonder that recruitment agents have such a bad reputation.

As a final note, I recommend having a read of <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mrwizard/web/job.html" title="v">this</a> marvellous article - those of you who have dealt with recruiters will no doubt enjoy it.
